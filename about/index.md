### Professional

I am a software craftsman with 13+ years of professional experience doing consulting in both the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.  I've spent the vast majority of my career working on Java applications, so I'm fluent in the Spring framework, JPA, Hibernate, Eclipse, and all the stuff that you'd expect from a Java guy with that level of experience.

In 2011 I worked on my first .Net projects using C# and have been very pleasantly surprised at the language and platform in general and wish I'd gotten into it sooner.

On the front end HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, and Knockout have been my tools of choice, but I think I'd like to use AngularJS next chance I get.

Since 2006 I've been working for the best little software shop in the midwest: [Centare](http://www.centare.com)   

{% comment %}Shit I hate people that just list a bunch of languages and think that means the reader now knows them.  Maybe later I'll write this up better.{% endcomment %}
