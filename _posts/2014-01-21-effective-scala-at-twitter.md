One of the things I want to do with this blog is use it as a repository for things I think I could use as a reference at some future point.

The twitter team is maintaining a post detailing some of the Scala best practices that they've adopted and learned while working with the language over the past several years.  I think this serves as a great starting point for determining my own practices/style.
